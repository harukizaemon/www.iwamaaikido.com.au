        <h2>Technical Diary, Iwama, Japan 2007</h2>
      </header>

      <div class="col-sm-12">
        <p>In 2007 my wife, Jesseca, and I moved to Iwama, Japan so that I could live and train as Sotodeshi for a year. During our stay we were fortunate to become pregnant with our first child and we returned to Australia a little sooner than anticipated. It was a wonderful experience for both of us and we hope to do it again someday with our now three children!</p>

        <p>I&rsquo;ve never really been one to take notes but this trip I decided I would make an effort to at least give it a try. I also determined to record only Sensei&rsquo;s direct instruction. It goes without saying that Sensei is always progressing. Still, my feeling was that if I wrote down exactly what Sensei said&mdash;rather than some interpretation&mdash;then it would be more likely to stand the test of time. Of course, it also follows that by the time you read this Sensei will have further advanced in his research rendering some if not much of these notes obsolete!</p>

        <p>So, for better or worse, I present to you my largely unedited technical diary translated as best I could at the time from Japanese into English with as little (hopefully none) personal interpretation as possible.</p>

        <p>To paraphrase a <a href="http://leeattey.wordpress.com/">friend and fellow Aikidoka</a>, <em>I hope this is interesting.</em></p>

      <div class="col-sm-10">
        <p>Chinkon: Sit with your knees shoulder width apart. Have your hands either on your knees or placed one on top of the other in front of you. Extend your lower back and spine, hold your head straight and relax your shoulders. Your eyes should be neither wide open nor shut tight. Gaze softly at the insides of your eyelids. Inhale slowly and deeply (over a period of 7 seconds) through your nose. Visualise your breath moving from your chest down into your Tanden (a point midway between your navel and groin) and hold it there for 7 seconds (longer if you can). As you exhale (again, over a period of 7 seconds), listen to the sound of your breath as it moves from your stomach up to your chest and finally out through your nose. Breath in the energy from heaven and from the earth and bind them together. Move this energy circularly and continuously around your body so that it fills entirely. For men, move the energy from a point in the middle of your forehead, down the your front of your body to your Tanden then up your back to the forehead. For women, move the energy from a point in the middle of your forehead, down your back to a point midway between your forehead and Tanden then up your front to the forehead. You should begin to feel your body temperature increase and in some cases your skin become slightly itchy. This sensation can be quite pronounced in women especially but also in men and should fade after a month or so.
Whilst you are practising, try to not to cough, sneeze or otherwise make a sound (other than your own breathing) and ignore all other sounds and distractions. If for any reason you are unable to practice (for example if you have a cold) or if you need to leave at anytime, stay outside and in the case of morning training, perhaps go to the forest and wait.</p>

        <p>Morote dori ikkyo is one of the best practices you can do. Use the outside hand well. Use both hands to cut around.</p>

        <p>Moroto dori ikkyo urawaza: we used to go toe-to-toe but people move around in different ways. Rather than focusing on moving toe-to-toe, concentrate more on taking their balance. Look at where their head is and from that, gauge where the foot should go.</p>

      <div class="col-sm-10">
        <p>Ushiro ryote dori, eri dori: always be in gyaku hanmi so that your partner can attempt to unbalance you. Always move to the side of your partners front foot. Don&rsquo;t clash. Rather, twist your hips and your arm at the same time to unbalance them. Uke initiates by striking for the face then jumps around behind. Nage should awase back so that they stay more or less beside the attacker.</p>

        <p>Don&rsquo;t focus on throwing. If you always focus on throwing you&rsquo;ll never get any better. Think more about blending (awase). If you can take your partners balance, the throw is easy. In reality there is no throw, you would grab the head, neck, break the elbow etc. Throwing and falling with rolls, high-falls, etc. is a means by which we can continue practising without hurting each other.</p>

      <div class="col-sm-10">
        <p>Tsuki: ensure you pull back in a straight line as much as possible behind you. Allow the front arm to relax&mdash;like a turtle&rsquo;s head pulling back into it&rsquo;s shell&mdash;to facilitate a longer reach backwards. Always keep the little finger and next finger gripping. As you thrust allow the rear arm to rotate down from the elbow. Ensure your hands are both on top of the jo.</p>

        <p>Kaeshi/choku-tsuki: don&rsquo;t allow the jo to lift higher than it&rsquo;s starting position. Draw the jo backwards as you move forwards. Thrust all the way forwards ensuring your shoulders remain in hitoemi.</p>

        <p>O&rsquo;Sensei said: <em>kokyu is oshi-dasu&mdash;pushing/extending forwards.</em><p>

        <p>31-kumijo moves #2 and #3: Teach beginners to make a big move. However, as you progress, the move should become smaller and instead of moving backwards, take a slight adjustment to the side and move your hips so as to avoid the jo.<p>

        <p>31-kumijo move #9: Attack the knee.</p>

        <p>31-kumijo move #10: the basic form is to strike the attackers outside wrist as this is the safest way to protect their face. If they are striking correctly then it probably doesn&rsquo;t matter but beginners especially leave their elbows out thus exposing their face. For more ad-vanced students, strike for the inside elbow.</p>

        <p>31-kumijo #3: Drop the right hand then the left. Don&rsquo;t try to knock the jo away or towards you. The angle of your jo should be sufficient to deflect your partners jo. After contact, turn immediately into jo kamae ready for a tsuki.</p>

        <p>31-kumijo #2 and #4, etc.: Move back sufficiently to maintain the same ma-ai.<p>

        <p>Morotedori kokyu nage: twist your hips sufficiently to take your partners balance off their back leg but not so far that they will regain their balance. Don&rsquo;t step back so far as to put your partner back on balance. The taller they are, the further from them you&rsquo;ll need to step.</p>

        <p>Kata-dori ikkyo, et al: step diagonally off the line to your partners weak line into a wide hanmi&mdash;kenka goshi&mdash;with the shoulders and hips turned. Don&rsquo;t make contact with the punch. Twist the hips not towards your partner but almost back towards where you were standing when you first started&mdash;perhaps even more&mdash;using the shoulder and either punch to the ribs or place the blade of the hand behind the elbow.</p>

        <p>Nikkyo: the hand that grabs the wrist should come from below in order to turn the arm over. Shodan level students should be able to take a nikkyo relatively naturally without it being excruciatingly painful.</p>

        <p>31-kata #19: Ensure you draw back completely.</p>

        <p>31-kata #29: Make a big move backwards.</p>

        <p>31-kumijo #24-#25: Teach beginners as two separate moves. In reality it should be two tsukis joined (ni-dan tsuki).</p>

        <p>Hanmi: definitely hips forward horizontal and head vertical&mdash;not leaning sideways.</p>

        <p>31-kumijo #26: adjust the front foot into hanmi towards your partner to enable the next move to be quick.</p>

        <p>31-kumijo #28 (uke): Make a big move backwards to give enough room.</p>

        <p>Jo partner practices: Moving backwards is difficult so you must practice it often. Moving forwards is easy&mdash;even a child can do it&mdash;but moving backwards is hard. Ensure that you maintain the same distance (ma-ai) between you and your partner at all times.</p>

        <p>Morotedori kokyu nage: Once you&rsquo;ve taken your partner&rsquo;s balance, enter in just enough to make contact, remain solid in hanmi and twist your hips whilst kokyuing around. Don&rsquo;t enter in too deply or you will clash&mdash;and often put them back on balance.</p>

        <p>Ikkyo omote waza, et al: Always maintain contact with both hands. If the outside hand is losing contact, chances are your opening out too far on the initial move.</p>

        <p>Ikkyo ura waza, et al: Ensure you grip with the outside hand as well otherwise they are more likely to escape.</p>

        <p>Kumitachi/Kumijo: Too much awase practice is no good&mdash;the attacker (uchi-tachi) doesn&rsquo;t learn where to cut or thrust properly and ends up following the defender (uke-tachi). Always do stop-start practice. Another good practice is to allow the attacker to complete the first half/first step of their strike/thrust and move on the second half/second step.</p>

        <p>6th awase: start a little further apart than for 5th awase otherwise there is no reason to perform the thrust; the first cut doesn&rsquo;t reach far enough thus necessitating a thrust.</p>

Go toe-to-toe&mdash;or knee-to-knee&mdash;at first but then you can separate in order to generate an ever increasing spiral outwards.</p>

        <p>Morote-dori and other kokyu nage: You must understand the distinction between the strong, slightly forwards, tai-no-henko finish-like stance, and the throw at which point your body should be perfectly balanced both vertically and horizontally as you twist your hips to throw.</p>

        <p>Ikkyo omote and ura: you must enter with your feet and hips at the same time. Don&rsquo;t cock your hip out as your feet will be too slow.</p>

The first position should be exactly like the finish of 1st suburi and tai-no-henko. This takes your partner off balance. For the throw, the body should be perfectly vertical and horizontal as the hips twist. The movement for the throw should not be on the same line as the first movement.</p>

        <p>Hasso-gaeshi tsuki: there are two variations: the one most people are used to&mdash;kaeshi where you turn the jo whilst holding it in the middle&semi; and sugu modosu where the jo returns to hasso position directly without turning it over.</p>

        <p>Hanmi-handachi shiho nage, katate-dori: Raise the hands above the head so as to prevent your partner from striking. Do this in a spiral motion away from your partner using kokyu. Make the center of the movement the knee which is furthest away from your parnter. Take the foot on the side closest to your partner and step to the outside of your other knee as you spin around until you face back towards them. In the old daito-ryu version, you would stay where you were and bring your partner all the way around your body. O&rsquo;Sensei realised there was a problem with this and changed it to the present form.</p>

        <p>Hanmi-handachi shiho nage, ryote-dori: Both hands are being held so there is the possibility of being pulled over if you attempt a movement similar to the katate-dori version. Instead, step in close to your partner ensuring you bring your back leg along with you. Grab as deeply on your partners arm as possible and use both hands to lock up your partners arm. Then use both legs and stand up. DONT turn. Wait until you&rsquo;ve stood all the way up. Lift the hands up as high as possible. At this point you may be a little off balance so pull your foot in towards you to regain balance, then throw.</p>

We usually have the tip always facing towards our partner so as to keep the jo alive (ikiteru) but in this case there&rsquo;s really no reason for your partner to enter if we do that so let the tip die (shinu). All the parries must be from above otherwise your jo will be cut. The parries are NOT the same as when parrying a jo because a sword has a blade. yYur body movement should be so as to avoid the sword (kawasu).

      <div class="col-sm-10">
        <p>Tachi-dori: From right hanmi, right hand awase up with rising sword. Move in so that you are still in right hanmi facing towards the centre-line of your partner. Block their front (right) hand with your right hand to prevent them from cutting at you. Grab in between their hands. Kokyu forwards from below. At the same time shift your hanmi so that your are in front of your partner and facing in the same direction. Ensure your back foot follows&mdash;don&rsquo;t leave it behind. Continue forwards as you extend your arm for the throw. To get an idea of how to move the sword, try this as an exercise: after the first move in, place your right hand on your partners back (left) hand and push it around. You should find this very easy to do. This is the same angle you should aim for when gripping the sword. In fact sometimes your partner is gripping with their hands so close together that it&rsquo;s difficult to get a proper grip on their sword. In this case, try gripping with only your thumb and fore-finger with the remaining fingers pushing against your partners back (left) hand. Continue as per normal and grip fully as you execute the throw. Adjust the sword so the tip points forwards to finish in a kind of one-handed kamae.</p>

        <p>Tachi-dori: From left hanmi, because you&rsquo;re entering into your partner&rsquo;s right side, your hand cannot enter from above. Instead, enter in with your left foot slightly wider than you did on the other side. Keep your arm relatively extended and come in to grab the sword from the side. Awase with the downward movement of the sword and pivot on the left foot to end up facing in the same direction as your partner but in the reverse hanmi. Take the sword and extend it in front of your centre line. Taking your partners balance&mdash;don&rsquo;t try to
twist the sword!&mdash;lift straight up from below, pushing up naturally along the line of the sword. Move forwards and cut as with a sword.</p>

        <p>Cutting: When cutting, ensure your head remains upright and looking straight ahead. Don&rsquo;t lower and subsequently raise your head. Don&rsquo;t bob your head up and down. There is an old video of O&rsquo;Sensei at a Dojo in Osaka when he is in his 50&rsquo;s or so. In this video you can quite clearly see O&rsquo;Sensei bobbing his head up and down as he cuts. This is incorrect and O&rsquo;Sensei subsequently change his form accordingly. O&rsquo;Sensei would say that it&rsquo;s no good to have this extra movement in your head. It&rsquo;s a waste of effort. You need to keep your head steady as you cut.</p>

        <p>31-kumijo #1: As the attacker, the initial strike must be a full tsuki&mdash;don&rsquo;t shorten the movement in anticipation of the next move. As the other person performs a kaeshi tsuki, continue the movement forwards and adjust your back (right) leg so as to avoid (kawasu) and parry.</p>

        <p>Mune-dori Jyujinage: Start in gyaku hanmi. Move diagonally backwards in the same hanmi. Never step back with the front foot as you will be too easily unbalanced. Take your partner&rsquo;s balance and punch to their ribs&mdash;don&rsquo;t make contact just make the form. They are holding your chest so it will be easier if you use your body to unbalance them. Cross your partners arms in a cross. Step circularly forwards, slightly away from your partner. Your arms and feet should always point in the same direction as you throw.</p>

        <p>5th Kumi-tachi: Start with sword tips a short distance apart. Uchi-tachi must really jump in far enough to reach the uke-tachi. Uke-tachi jumps around&mdash;this is the only time uke-tachi makes a big move&mdash;and cuts from the side. Uchi-tachi spins on the spot and uses the sword to cover. From here uchi-tachi would, in reality, go straight into a strike so there isn&rsquo;t enough time to extend the arms so leave them in the defensive position. Uke-tachi defends then pushes, using kokyu, with both hands towards uchi-tachi&rsquo;s centre line so as to push them backwards. Uchi-tachi doesn&rsquo;t resist. Instead, they move slightly to the side and attack the front leg. Uke-tachi drops their sword down in a direct line and steps back so as to line up with the uchi-tachi&rsquo;s strike. Finish with one more strike.</p>

        <p>In Aikido there is no pulling only extension (oshi-dasu). Judo has pulling, aikido has pushing-out. Don&rsquo;t allow yourself to get pulled in to your partner, rather, make the correct form, stay on balance, protect both centrelines (vertical and horizontal) and twist around the vertical line. Both centrelines should meet at your belly button. When moving in towards your partner, always put your centreline in the middle of your partner and your own
centreline. Don&rsquo;t clash with them. Don&rsquo;t think about pushing them over or throwing them. Instead imagine you are drawing them towards you like gravity. Don&rsquo;t get drawn towards them. You must always maintain your own balance and take theirs.</p>

        <p>Morote-dori kokyo-nage: don&rsquo;t allow your arm to be too far away from your body. The closer to your body the better. Don&rsquo;t allow your arm to go over the line of your partners hanmi. Throw from below like a wave come up from below. Don&rsquo;t let your arm get above shoulder/chest height. Your partner should be attracted towards you like gravity (inshinryoku).</p>

        <p>Shomen-uchi Ikkyo omoto-waza: your partner should always have the feeling of parrying your strike. Enter in with kokyu on the inside arm to stop them from pushing back. Don&rsquo;t enter too deeply but not too far away either. Don&rsquo;t enter in too close nor too wide. Grab the pulse with the outside hand. Extend out so their arm is at 90 degrees, then twist your hips and cut spirally. Push with both arms.</p>

        <p>Shomen-uchi ikkyo ura-waza: enter exactly as for tai-no-henki. Extend with the inside hand so that it stays in front of your body. Again, grab the pulse and extend. Once you have unbalanced your partner, then you can move around spirally. The first move MUST be toe-to-toe&mdash;big toe matching with big toe. After you&rsquo;ve unbalanced your partner then there is no need to stay matching toes. Just like tai-no-henko. Don&rsquo;t push from above. Ensure your partner&rsquo;s arm stays at 90 degrees. The further their arm is away from their body the better. Your partner on the other hand must not walk around. They must grip and try to hold their ground (funbaru). This also applies to omote-waza.</p>

        <p>Suwari-waza kokyo-ho: bring your arms up spirally out and then in towards your centreline. Don&rsquo;t allow your own body to get pulled in. You should be lifting your partner up and in towards you.</p>

If you do this you will just push yourself up. Instead, come from underneath and push your partner up. As you push you will become even more stable as you screw down into the ground. Keep your arm at chest/shoulder height and kokyu.</p>

        <p>Kiai/3rd ken suburi: There are 5 basic sounds in the Japanese language: a-i-u-e-o. This is the new ordering. The old order is different. i is the highest-level sounds. A kiai should come from your hara. During meditation use your body to channel the energy from heaven and earth and combine (musubu) and concentrate them in your hara. Then let out that energy (ki) like an explosion.</p>

        <p>7th ken suburi: Be careful. This is where most people have a bad habit, going from the tsuki&mdash;which is in hitoemi&mdash;to a correct 5th suburi because their body is very open for the tsuki.</p>

        <p>5th awase: the ken should finish down, and coming directly from your belly button. You should be in hanmi NOT hitoemi.</p>

        <p>Ichi no kumi-tachi: As the uchi-tachi raises, move diagnoally off the line. Turn your shoulders to face your partner as you would for 5th awase. Skewer (zashi) their stomach then slice back along the line of the blade and the up above your head. A sword needs to be used in a cutting motion not a chopping motion. Just like a chef slices rather than chops with a knife. Pull with the left hand more than the right to get the movement.</p>

        <p>Morote-dori kokyunage: Your elbow should always be down and your wrist up at chest (mune) height. Definitely don&rsquo;t roll your arm so far that the hand is below the elbow. The wrist must definitely be above the elbow. Don&rsquo;t turn to face your partner. Kep looking in the same direction as your partner and step back into them as you kokyu both hands out.</p>

        <p>Shomen-uchi nikkyo omotewaza: Cut your partner out and around. Definitely don&rsquo;t stay in the same spot as your first move as this is completely wrong. You should not be facing your partner. Turn enough that you are facing in the same direction as they are.</p>

        <p>Shomen-unchi nikkyo urawaza: Grab the wrist from underneath. If you grab from above you won&rsquo;t be able to take the grip on the hand. Make sure you twist your hips to apply the nikkyo. Don&rsquo;t put the wrist in the mniddle of your chest or you will end up facing your partner. Put it into the shoulder. Then you can use the shoulder.</p>

Step back and down with the other foot, keeping their elbow infront of you and your arms extended as you place the knee down and their shoulder into the mat. Once their arm is completely vertical, then change the grip to pin keeping contact the whole way.</p>

        <p>Tachi-dori most basic kokyu nage on the right-hand-side: Enter in and block the front hand so as to prevent them from cutting you; as you grab the sword, use the back-end (tsukao) and push it out to extend their shoulder and step around so you are facing the same direction as they are. Extend with kokyu. You should be slightly in front of their front foot. Don&rsquo;t go backwards or your arm will collapse. You must extend forwards. Throw with the legs.</p>

        <p>Throwing: don&rsquo;t tense your upper body. Don&rsquo;t use power above the waist. Your should relax your shoulders and upper body and drop your centre of balance. Move from your middle/centre.</p>

        <p>Tachi-dori most basic kokyunage on the left-hand-side: grab the wrist not the hand or the sword. Dis-tance (ma-ai) is most important. Too close and you won&rsquo;t be able to take their balance. Too far and you won&rsquo;t be able to reach them. Ensure you push (funbaru) with the back leg. Have a posture that is forwards. Don&rsquo;t have all the weight on the back foot. Take their balance diagonally NOT straight forwards. The taller the partner, the further out you will need to be. Once you&rsquo;ve taken their balance, throw behind yourself. Don&rsquo;t step back into them or you will put them back on balance.</p>

        <p>Tachi-dori on the same side coming under the arm: enter in with body in hitoemi. Don&rsquo;t enter in too deeply. Under the armpits is too far. Somewhere around the elbow in between the armpit and the elbow is about right. Don&rsquo;t grab the ken until after they&rsquo;ve finished cutting down. Take your partner all the way to the front. Use your legs to throw and lower your arms to the ground.</p>

        <p>2nd kumitachi move #2: when uke-tachi moves they could attach the wrist, or they could attach the chest with a tsuki. There are many things they could do. The important thing to remember is that the intention is to attack. It is because if this intention that uchi-tachi moves into a tsuki.</p>

        <p>5th, 6th and 7th awase: Especially for beginners, do a practice which is somewhere in between awase and stop-start. This will give the uchi-tachi and idea of where they should be cutting/tsukiing. Uke-tachi begins to move about mid-way through the uchi-tachi&rsquo;s movement.</p>

        <p>Attacking with ken: Always cut for where the uke-tachi was standing when you initiated the move, NOT where they have moved to.</p>

      <div class="col-sm-10">
        <p>Everything in Aikido comes from the sword. 1st suburi forms the basis for all movements in Aikido. Try to imagine your body like a lens, focusing the energy from your body out through the sword. Stand in hanmi. Lower your hips (koshi otoshite). Pull your belly button back (oheso hiite). This allows you to focus the energy. If you stand up straight all your energy will disperse all around you.</p>

<p>Body movement: No matter what you do you should always be in either hanmi or hitoemi. This body movement (taisabaki) really distinguishes Aikido from other martial arts such as karate. It&rsquo;s easy to step forwards. Moving backwards is difficult. Always try to take as much of a step back as possible to train your body. Maintain the same maai the whole time.</p>

<p>Receiving with Ken: Never let the sword tilt/rotate sideways from the vertical when receiving. Always receive with the butt of the sword facing to your belly button and the back of the sword on your centre line. This protects your whole body. If you open the sword out even slightly you will leave an opening and you will be cut.</p>

<p>Tsuki from a parry: Kill the tip of the sword (ken sen o korosu). If it stays alive (ikiteru) it&rsquo;s difficult to move. Tsuki from below otherwise the receiver (uke tachi) can easily parry you by simply moving their sword from side to side; the same applies to 5th suburi which is why we must attack from out wide, on an angle. The tip of the sword should scribe the Japanese character の (no).</p>

<p>2nd kumitachi, move #1: when attacking and receiving make sure the sword is always pointing at your belly button. Don&rsquo;t allow your body to tilt sideays. Whether you cut to the middle (chudan), down (gedan) or up (jodan), you should always be in hanmi and the sword pointing from your belly button.</p>

<p>Ken Parry (Harai): don&rsquo;t parry with the blade or you will damage it. Parry with the side of the sword. Use the left (ie back) hand as well as the right (ie front) hand. Don&rsquo;t turn the sword over the way the old senpai used to do.<p>

<p>Attacking with the ken: Cutting straight down the middle line of your body is the strongest. If your body is turning as you cut the strike becomes weak and especially when doing yokomen, centrifugal force will cause your cut to move off line. This is why it is so important to protect the 3 points: spine (sebone)&semi; top of the head (atama)&semi; and belly button (hesso).</p>

<p>Hanmi handachi katate dori kotegaeshi: You can either turn the palm towards you or grip from underneath. Don&rsquo;t try to cut down as you would when standing as your partner will just pull their arm away.</p>

<p>Hanmi handachi kokyu nage: move out to the side and raise your arm up as high as you can. Try to get their own arm at 90 degrees so you can take their balance. Step in towards their back foot and throw in front of yourself.</p>

        <p>Hanmi: the back foot must be rotated forwards in order to have the knee pointing fowards so you can push off. Leaving the foot at 90 degrees means you haven&rsquo;t turned your foot enough. If you don&rsquo;t turn your feet enough you wont be able to use your hips&emdash;for example in morote dori kokynage.</p>

        <p>Kokyu nage vs. sumi o oshi: in kokyu nage you move slightly off the line and break your partner&rsquo;s balance and continue to throw along the same line. In sumi-o-toshi you move
around to the side more and throw to the &rsquo;corners&rsquo; of the room. Don&rsquo;t step in to your partner. You must use kokyu to take their balance.</p>

        <p>Kaiten nage: the hand must be on the back of the head with your thumb down and palm pointng away from you; make sure their arm is extended and makes a 90 degree angle to their shoulders. Step diagonally between their shoulder and stomach&mdash;don&rsquo;t step forwards.</p>

        <p>Handmi handachi kaiten nage: you need to move further away from your partner than you would for standing&mdash;nough so that you could sweep their leg with your inside hand.</p>

        <p>katate hachi no jigaeshi: in reality you would move forwards. For suburi we keep our arms relatively close to the body but if you were actually striking someone that would hurt your wrists. If you want to actually strike someone you need to extend out more.</p>

        <p>hasso gaeshi ushiro tsuki: drop the jo down directly under the elbow. Don&rsquo;t reach forwards.</p>

        <p>hasso gaeshi ushiro uchi: we used to drop back to strike but that is a bit dangerous so we now move in the direction of the strike. You could also move out to the left and to the right.</p>

        <p>hidari nagare gaeshi uchi: after the cut, keep your left hand connected to the jo and bring it above your head. Finish with a strike.</p>
