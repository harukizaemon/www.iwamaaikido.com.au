      </header>

      <div class="col-sm-offset-2 col-sm-8">
        <p>In 2007 my wife, Jesseca, and I moved to Iwama, Japan so that I could live and train as Sotodeshi for a year. During our stay we were fortunate to become pregnant with our first child and we returned to Australia a little sooner than anticipated. It was a wonderful experience for both of us and we hope to do it again someday with our now three children!</p>

        <p>Although I have visited the Dojo in Iwama a dozen or more times, I've never really been one to take notes. Perhaps because of the lifestyle of an Uchideshi or perhaps laziness on my part I'm not sure. In any event, during this trip I decided that I would make a concerted effort to take notes. The question was, what form should they take?</p>

        <p>My theory was this: Sensei is decades ahead of where I am with my technique. Although he is always improving and thus always getting further away from me, if in twenty years I could be as good as he is today, I'd be very happy. In addition, because I am so far behind in my understanding it follows that if I write down exactly what Sensei says&mdash;rather than some interpretation of what he said&mdash;then it is more likely to stand the test of time. Or, at the very least, he will move on but at least I have a fighting chance of catching up :)</p>

        <p>And so, for better or worse, here is my technical diary translated as best I could at the time directly from Japanese into English with as little (hopefully none) personal interpretation as possible.</p>

        <p>To paraphrase <a href="http://leeattey.wordpress.com/">a friend and fellow Aikidoka</a>: <em>"I hope this is interesting."</em></p>
