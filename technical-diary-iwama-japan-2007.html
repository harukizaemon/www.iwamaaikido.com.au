        <h2>Technical Diary, Iwama, Japan 2007</h2>
      </header>

      <div class="col-sm-12">
        <p>In 2007 my wife, Jesseca, and I moved to Iwama, Japan so that I could live and train as Sotodeshi for a year. During our stay we were fortunate to become pregnant with our first child and we returned to Australia a little sooner than anticipated. It was a wonderful experience for both of us and we hope to do it again someday with our now three children!</p>

        <p>Although I have visited the Dojo in Iwama a dozen or more times, I've never really been one to take notes. Perhaps because of the lifestyle of an Uchideshi or perhaps laziness on my part I'm not sure. In any event, during this trip I decided that I would make a concerted effort to take notes. The question was, what form should they take?</p>

        <p>My theory was this: Sensei is decades ahead of where I am with my technique. Although he is always improving and thus always getting further away from me, if in twenty years I could be as good as he is today, I'd be very happy. In addition, because I am so far behind in my understanding, it follows that if I write down exactly what Sensei says&mdash;rather than some interpretation of what he said&mdash;then it is more likely to stand the test of time. Or, at the very least, he will move on but at least I have a fighting chance of catching up :)</p>

        <p>And so, for better or worse, I present to you my largely unedited technical diary translated as best I could at the time from Japanese into English with as little (hopefully none) personal interpretation as possible.</p>

        <p>To paraphrase <a href="http://leeattey.wordpress.com/">a friend and fellow Aikidoka</a>, <em>I hope this is interesting.</em></p>

        <p>Morote dori ikkyo is one of the best practices you can do. Use the outside hand well. Ue both hands to cut around.</p>

        <p>Moroto dori ikkyo urawaza: we used to go toe-to-toe but people move around in different ways. Rather than focusing on moving toe-to-toe, concentrate more on taking their balance. Look at where their head is and from that, gauge where the foot should go.</p>

      <div class="col-sm-8">
        <p>Ushiro ryote dori, eri dori: always be in gyaku hanmi so that your partner can attempt to unbalance you. Always move to the side of your partners front foot. Don’t clash. Rather, twist your hips and your arm at the same time to unbalance them. Uke initiates by striking for the face then jumps around behind. Nage should awase back so that they stay more or less beside the attacker.</p>

        <p>Don’t focus on throwing. If you always focus on throwing you’ll never get any better. Think more about blending (awase). If you can take your partners balance, the throw is easy. In reality there is no throw, you would grab the head, neck, break the elbow etc. Throwing and falling with rolls, high-falls, etc. is a means by which we can continue practising without hurting each other.</p>
