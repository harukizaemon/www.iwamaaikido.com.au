        <h2>Technical Diary, Iwama, Japan 2007</h2>
      </header>

      <div class="col-sm-12">
        <p>In 2007 my wife, Jesseca, and I moved to Iwama, Japan so that I could live and train as Sotodeshi for a year. During our stay we were fortunate to become pregnant with our first child and we returned to Australia a little sooner than anticipated. It was a wonderful experience for both of us and we hope to do it again someday with our now three children!</p>

        <p>Although I have visited the Dojo in Iwama a dozen or more times, I&rsquo;ve never really been one to take notes. Perhaps because of the lifestyle of an Uchideshi or perhaps laziness on my part I&rsquo;m not sure. In any event, during this trip I decided that I would make a concerted effort to take notes. However, instead of writing down my observations, I determined to record only Sensei&rsquo;s direct instruction. My rationale was something like this:</p>

        <p>Sensei is a lifetime ahead of where I am with my technique. He is also always improving and thus always getting further away from me. If in twenty years I could be as good as he is today, I&rsquo;d be very happy. Furthermore, because I am so far behind in my understanding, it follows that if I write down exactly what Sensei says&mdash;rather than some interpretation of what he said&mdash;then it is more likely to stand the test of time. At the very least, he will have moved on but I would still have a fighting chance of catching up :)</p>

        <p>Of course it also follows that by the time you read this, Sensei will have moved on and thus some if not much of it will be out-of-date. Oh the irony!</p>

        <p>And so, for better or worse, I present to you my largely unedited technical diary translated as best I could at the time from Japanese into English with as little (hopefully none) personal interpretation as possible.</p>

        <p>To paraphrase <a href="http://leeattey.wordpress.com/">a friend and fellow Aikidoka</a>, <em>I hope this is interesting.</em></p>

      <div class="col-sm-10">
        <p>Chinkon: Sit with your knees shoulder width apart. Have your hands either on your knees or placed one on top of the other in front of you. Extend your lower back and spine, hold your head straight and relax your shoulders. Your eyes should be neither wide open nor shut tight. Gaze softly at the insides of your eyelids. Inhale slowly and deeply (over a period of 7 seconds) through your nose. Visualise your breath moving from your chest down into your Tanden (a point midway between your navel and groin) and hold it there for 7 seconds (longer if you can). As you exhale (again, over a period of 7 seconds), listen to the sound of your breath as it moves from your stomach up to your chest and finally out through your nose. Breath in the energy from heaven and from the earth and bind them together. Move this energy circularly and continuously around your body so that it fills entirely. For men, move the energy from a point in the middle of your forehead, down the your front of your body to your Tanden then up your back to the forehead. For women, move the energy from a point in the middle of your forehead, down your back to a point midway between your forehead and Tanden then up your front to the forehead. You should begin to feel your body temperature increase and in some cases your skin become slightly itchy. This sensation can be quite pronounced in women especially but also in men and should fade after a month or so.
Whilst you are practising, try to not to cough, sneeze or otherwise make a sound (other than your own breathing) and ignore all other sounds and distractions. If for any reason you are unable to practice (for example if you have a cold) or if you need to leave at anytime, stay outside and in the case of morning training, perhaps go to the forest and wait.</p>

        <p>Morote dori ikkyo is one of the best practices you can do. Use the outside hand well. Use both hands to cut around.</p>

        <p>Moroto dori ikkyo urawaza: we used to go toe-to-toe but people move around in different ways. Rather than focusing on moving toe-to-toe, concentrate more on taking their balance. Look at where their head is and from that, gauge where the foot should go.</p>

      <div class="col-sm-10">
        <p>Ushiro ryote dori, eri dori: always be in gyaku hanmi so that your partner can attempt to unbalance you. Always move to the side of your partners front foot. Don&rsquo;t clash. Rather, twist your hips and your arm at the same time to unbalance them. Uke initiates by striking for the face then jumps around behind. Nage should awase back so that they stay more or less beside the attacker.</p>

        <p>Don&rsquo;t focus on throwing. If you always focus on throwing you&rsquo;ll never get any better. Think more about blending (awase). If you can take your partners balance, the throw is easy. In reality there is no throw, you would grab the head, neck, break the elbow etc. Throwing and falling with rolls, high-falls, etc. is a means by which we can continue practising without hurting each other.</p>

      <div class="col-sm-10">
        <p>Tsuki: ensure you pull back in a straight line as much as possible behind you. Allow the front arm to relax&mdash;like a turtle&rsquo;s head pulling back into it&rsquo;s shell&mdash;to facilitate a longer reach backwards. Always keep the little finger and next finger gripping. As you thrust allow the rear arm to rotate down from the elbow. Ensure your hands are both on top of the jo.</p>

        <p>Kaeshi/choku-tsuki: don&rsquo;t allow the jo to lift higher than it&rsquo;s starting position. Draw the jo backwards as you move forwards. Thrust all the way forwards ensuring your shoulders remain in hitoemi.</p>

        <p>O&rsquo;Sensei said: <em>kokyu is oshi-dasu&mdash;pushing/extending forwards.</em><p>

        <p>31-kumijo moves #2 and #3: Teach beginners to make a big move. However, as you progress, the move should become smaller and instead of moving backwards, take a slight adjustment to the side and move your hips so as to avoid the jo.<p>

        <p>31-kumijo move #9: Attack the knee.</p>

        <p>31-kumijo move #10: the basic form is to strike the attackers outside wrist as this is the safest way to protect their face. If they are striking correctly then it probably doesn&rsquo;t matter but beginners especially leave their elbows out thus exposing their face. For more ad-vanced students, strike for the inside elbow.</p>

        <p>31-kumijo #3: Drop the right hand then the left. Don&rsquo;t try to knock the jo away or towards you. The angle of your jo should be sufficient to deflect your partners jo. After contact, turn immediately into jo kamae ready for a tsuki.</p>

        <p>31-kumijo #2 and #4, etc.: Move back sufficiently to maintain the same ma-ai.<p>

        <p>Morotedori kokyu nage: twist your hips sufficiently to take your partners balance off their back leg but not so far that they will regain their balance. Don&rsquo;t step back so far as to put your partner back on balance. The taller they are, the further from them you&rsquo;ll need to step.</p>

        <p>Kata-dori ikkyo, et al: step diagonally off the line to your partners weak line into a wide hanmi&mdash;kenka goshi&mdash;with the shoulders and hips turned. Don&rsquo;t make contact with the punch. Twist the hips not towards your partner but almost back towards where you were standing when you first started&mdash;perhaps even more&mdash;using the shoulder and either punch to the ribs or place the blade of the hand behind the elbow.</p>

        <p>Nikkyo: the hand that grabs the wrist should come from below in order to turn the arm over. Shodan level students should be able to take a nikkyo relatively naturally without it being excruciatingly painful.</p>

        <p>Tsuki-jodan-gaeshi-uchi: be in hanmi, jo sitting along the line of your shoulders above your head.</p>

        <p>31-kata #19: Ensure you draw back completely. 31-kata #29: Make a big move backwards.</p>

        <p>31-kata #31: Simply slide the right (forwards) hand closer towards the left (rear) hand as you lift above your head.</p>

        <p>31-kumijo #24-#25: Teach beginners as two separate moves. In reality it should be two tsukis joined (ni-dan tsuki).</p>

        <p>Hanmi: definitely hips forward horizontal and head vertical&mdash;not leaning sideways.</p>

        <p>31-kumijo #26: adjust the front foot into hanmi towards your partner to enable the next move to be quick.</p>

        <p>31-kumijo #28 (uke): Make a big move backwards to give enough room.</p>

        <p>31-kumijo #29: Make a big move backwards to have enough room to tsuki.</p>

        <p>Jo partner practices: Moving backwards is difficult so you must practice it often. Moving forwards is easy&mdash;even a child can do it&mdash;but moving backwards is hard. Ensure that you maintain the same distance (ma-ai) between you and your partner at all times.</p>

        <p>Morotedori kokyu nage: Once you&rsquo;ve taken your partner&rsquo;s balance, enter in just enough to make contact, remain solid in hanmi and twist your hips whilst kokyuing around. Don&rsquo;t enter in too deply or you will clash&mdash;and often put them back on balance.</p>

        <p>Ikkyo omote waza, et al: Always maintain contact with both hands. If the outside hand is losing contact, chances are your opening out too far on the initial move.</p>

        <p>Ikkyo ura waza, et al: Ensure you grip with the outside hand as well otherwise they are more likely to escape.</p>

        <p>Kumitachi/Kumijo: Too much awase practice is no good&mdash;the attacker (uchi-tachi) doesn&rsquo;t learn where to cut or thrust properly and ends up following the defender (uke-tachi). Always do stop-start practice. Another good practice is to allow the attacker to complete the first half/first step of their strike/thrust and move on the second half/second step.</p>

        <p>6th awase: start a little further apart than for 5th awase otherwise there is no reason to perform the thrust; the first cut doesn&rsquo;t reach far enough thus necessitating a thrust.</p>

        <p>Suwari-waza Ikkyo ura: The first move should be 70-80% or greater of the technique. It&rsquo;s pretty much all over after the first move. The remainder is just a pin. Go toe-to-toe&mdash;or knee-to-knee&mdash;at first but then you can separate in order to generate an ever increasing spiral outwards.</p>

        <p>Morote-dori and other kokyu nage: You must understand the distinction between the strong, slightly forwards, tai-no-henko finish-like stance, and the throw at which point your body should be perfectly balanced both vertically and horizontally as you twist your hips to throw.</p>

        <p>Ikkyo omote and ura: you must enter with your feet and hips at the same time. Don&rsquo;t cock your hip out as your feet will be too slow.</p>

The first position should be exactly like the finish of 1st suburi and tai-no-henko. This takes your partner off balance. For the throw, the body should be perfectly vertical and horizontal as the hips twist. The movement for the throw should not be on the same line as the first movement.</p>

        <p>Hasso-gaeshi tsuki: there are two variations: the one most people are used to&mdash;kaeshi where you turn the jo whilst holding it in the middle&semi; and sugu modosu where the jo returns to hasso position directly without turning it over.</p>

        <p>Hanmi-handachi shiho nage, katate-dori: Raise the hands above the head so as to prevent your partner from striking. Do this in a spiral motion away from your partner using kokyu. Make the center of the movement the knee which is furthest away from your parnter. Take the foot on the side closest to your partner and step to the outside of your other knee as you spin around until you face back towards them. In the old daito-ryu version, you would stay where you were and bring your partner all the way around your body. O&rsquo;Sensei realised there was a problem with this and changed it to the present form.</p>

        <p>Hanmi-handachi shiho nage, ryote-dori: Both hands are being held so there is the possibility of being pulled over if you attempt a movement similar to the katate-dori version. Instead, step in close to your partner ensuring you bring your back leg along with you. Grab as deeply on your partners arm as possible and use both hands to lock up your partners arm. Then use both legs and stand up. DONT turn. Wait until you&rsquo;ve stood all the way up. Lift the hands up as high as possible. At this point you may be a little off balance so pull your foot in towards you to regain balance, then throw.</p>

We usually have the tip always facing towards our partner so as to keep the jo alive (ikiteru) but in this case there&rsquo;s really no reason for your partner to enter if we do that so let the tip die (shinu). All the parries must be from above otherwise your jo will be cut.

      <div class="col-sm-10">
        <p>Tachi-dori: From right hanmi, right hand awase up with rising sword. Move in so that you are still in right hanmi facing towards the centre-line of your partner. Block their front (right) hand with your right hand to prevent them from cutting at you. Grab in between their hands. Kokyu forwards from below. At the same time shift your hanmi so that your are in front of your partner and facing in the same direction. Ensure your back foot follows&mdash;don&rsquo;t leave it behind. Continue forwards as you extend your arm for the throw. To get an idea of how to move the sword, try this as an exercise: after the first move in, place your right hand on your partners back (left) hand and push it around. You should find this very easy to do. This is the same angle you should aim for when gripping the sword. In fact sometimes your partner is gripping with their hands so close together that it&rsquo;s difficult to get a proper grip on their sword. In this case, try gripping with only your thumb and fore-finger with the remaining fingers pushing against your partners back (left) hand. Continue as per normal and grip fully as you execute the throw. Adjust the sword so the tip points forwards to finish in a kind of one-handed kamae.</p>

        <p>Tachi-dori: From left hanmi, because you&rsquo;re entering into your partner&rsquo;s right side, your hand cannot enter from above. Instead, enter in with your left foot slightly wider than you did on the other side. Keep your arm relatively extended and come in to grab the sword from the side. Awase with the downward movement of the sword and pivot on the left foot to end up facing in the same direction as your partner but in the reverse hanmi. Take the sword and extend it in front of your centre line. Taking your partners balance&mdash;don&rsquo;t try to
twist the sword!&mdash;lift straight up from below, pushing up naturally along the line of the sword. Move forwards and cut as with a sword.</p>

        <p>Cutting: When cutting, ensure your head remains upright and looking straight ahead. Don&rsquo;t lower and subsequently raise your head. Don&rsquo;t bob your head up and down. There is an old video of O&rsquo;Sensei at a Dojo in Osaka when he is in his 50&rsquo;s or so. In this video you can quite clearly see O&rsquo;Sensei bobbing his head up and down as he cuts. This is incorrect and O&rsquo;Sensei subsequently change his form accordingly. O&rsquo;Sensei would say that it&rsquo;s no good to have this extra movement in your head. It&rsquo;s a waste of effort. You need to keep your head steady as you cut.</p>

        <p>31-kumijo #1: As the attacker, the initial strike must be a full tsuki&mdash;don&rsquo;t shorten the movement in anticipation of the next move. As the other person performs a kaeshi tsuki, continue the movement forwards and adjust your back (right) leg so as to avoid (kawasu) and parry.</p>

        <p>Mune-dori Jyujinage: Start in gyaku hanmi. Move diagonally backwards in the same hanmi. Never step back with the front foot as you will be too easily unbalanced. Take your partner&rsquo;s balance and punch to their ribs&mdash;don&rsquo;t make contact just make the form. They are holding your chest so it will be easier if you use your body to unbalance them. Cross your partners arms in a cross. Step circularly forwards, slightly away from your partner. Your arms and feet should always point in the same direction as you throw.</p>

        <p>5th kumi-jo, #3: Of course when teaching beginners you should do the movements as stop-start but in reality as soon as you see your partner move into katate-gedan gaeshi, you should be moving backwards. The move backwards should be first back, then cover, then down.</p>

        <p>5th Kumi-tachi: Start with sword tips a short distance apart. Uchi-tachi must really jump in far enough to reach the uke-tachi. Uke-tachi jumps around&mdash;this is the only time uke-tachi makes a big move&mdash;and cuts from the side. Uchi-tachi spins on the spot and uses the sword to cover. From here uchi-tachi would, in reality, go straight into a strike so there isn&rsquo;t enough time to extend the arms so leave them in the defensive position. Uke-tachi defends then pushes, using kokyu, with both hands towards uchi-tachi&rsquo;s centre line so as to push them backwards. Uchi-tachi doesn&rsquo;t resist. Instead, they move slightly to the side and attack the front leg. Uke-tachi drops their sword down in a direct line and steps back so as to line up with the uchi-tachi&rsquo;s strike. Finish with one more strike.</p>

        <p>In Aikido there is no pulling only extension (oshi-dasu). Judo has pulling, aikido has pushing-out. Don&rsquo;t allow yourself to get pulled in to your partner, rather, make the correct form, stay on balance, protect both centrelines (vertical and horizontal) and twist around the vertical line. Both centrelines should meet at your belly button. When moving in towards your partner, always put your centreline in the middle of your partner and your own
centreline. Don&rsquo;t clash with them. Don&rsquo;t think about pushing them over or throwing them. Instead imagine you are drawing them towards you like gravity. Don&rsquo;t get drawn towards them. You must always maintain your own balance and take theirs.</p>
