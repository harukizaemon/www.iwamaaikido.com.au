        <h2>Technical Diary, Iwama, Japan 2007</h2>
      </header>

      <div class="col-sm-12">
        <p>In 2007 my wife, Jesseca, and I moved to Iwama, Japan so that I could live and train as Sotodeshi for a year. During our stay we were fortunate to become pregnant with our first child and we returned to Australia a little sooner than anticipated. It was a wonderful experience for both of us and we hope to do it again someday with our now three children!</p>

        <p>Although I have visited the Dojo in Iwama a dozen or more times, I&rsquo;ve never really been one to take notes. Perhaps because of the lifestyle of an Uchideshi or perhaps laziness on my part I&rsquo;m not sure. In any event, during this trip I decided that I would make a concerted effort to take notes. The question was, what form should they take?</p>

        <p>My theory was this: Sensei is decades ahead of where I am with my technique. Although he is always improving and thus always getting further away from me, if in twenty years I could be as good as he is today, I&rsquo;d be very happy. In addition, because I am so far behind in my understanding, it follows that if I write down exactly what Sensei says&mdash;rather than some interpretation of what he said&mdash;then it is more likely to stand the test of time. At the very least, he will move on but I have a fighting chance of catching up :)</p>

        <p>And so, for better or worse, I present to you my largely unedited technical diary translated as best I could at the time from Japanese into English with as little (hopefully none) personal interpretation as possible.</p>

        <p>To paraphrase <a href="http://leeattey.wordpress.com/">a friend and fellow Aikidoka</a>, <em>I hope this is interesting.</em></p>

        <p>Morote dori ikkyo is one of the best practices you can do. Use the outside hand well. Use both hands to cut around.</p>

        <p>Moroto dori ikkyo urawaza: we used to go toe&ndash;to&ndash;toe but people move around in different ways. Rather than focusing on moving toe-to-toe, concentrate more on taking their balance. Look at where their head is and from that, gauge where the foot should go.</p>

      <div class="col-sm-10">
        <p>Ushiro ryote dori, eri dori: always be in gyaku hanmi so that your partner can attempt to unbalance you. Always move to the side of your partners front foot. Don&rsquo;t clash. Rather, twist your hips and your arm at the same time to unbalance them. Uke initiates by striking for the face then jumps around behind. Nage should awase back so that they stay more or less beside the attacker.</p>

        <p>Don&rsquo;t focus on throwing. If you always focus on throwing you&rsquo;ll never get any better. Think more about blending (awase). If you can take your partners balance, the throw is easy. In reality there is no throw, you would grab the head, neck, break the elbow etc. Throwing and falling with rolls, high-falls, etc. is a means by which we can continue practising without hurting each other.</p>

        <h4>Sunday&nbsp;22nd</h4>
      </header>

      <div class="col-sm-10">
        <p>Tsuki: ensure you pull back in a straight line as much as possible behind you. Allow the front arm to relax (like a turtle&rsquo;s head pulling back into it&rsquo;s shell) to facilitate a longer reach backwards. Always keep the little finger and next finger gripping. As you thrust allow the rear arm to rotate down from the elbow. Ensure your hands are both on top of the jo.</p>

        <p>Kaeshi/choku-tsuki: don&rsquo;t allow the jo to lift higher than it&rsquo;s starting position. Draw the jo backwards as you move forwards. Thrust all the way forwards ensuring your shoulders remain in hitoemi.</p>

        <p>O&ndash;Sensei said: <em>kokyu is oshi&ndash;dasu (pushing/extending forwards).</em><p>

        <p>31-kumijo moves #2 & #3: Teach beginners to make a big move. However, as you progress, the move should become smaller and instead of moving backwards, take a slight adjustment to the side and move your hips so as to avoid the jo.<p>

        <p>31-kumijo move #9: Attack the knee.</p>

        <p>31-kumijo move #10: the basic form is to strike the attackers outside wrist as this is the safest way to protect their face. If they are striking correctly then it probably doesn&rsquo;t matter but beginners especially leave their elbows out thus exposing their face. For more ad-vanced students, strike for the inside elbow.</p>

      </header>

      <div class="col-sm-10">
        <p>31-kumijo #3: Drop the right hand then the left. Don’t try to knock the jo away or towards you. The angle of your jo should be sufficient to deflect your partners jo. After contact, turn immediately into jo kamae ready for a tsuki.</p>

        <p>31-kumijo #2 & #4, etc.: Move back sufficiently to maintain the same ma-ai.<p>

        <p>Morotedori kokyu nage: twist your hips sufficiently to take your partners balance off their back leg but not so far that they will regain their balance. Don’t step back so far as to put your partner back on balance. The taller they are, the further from them you’ll need to step.</p>

        <p>Kata-dori ikkyo, et al: step diagonally off the line to your partners weak line into to a wide hanmi (kenka goshi - most definitely this is like hanmi, not like hito-e-mi) with the shoulders and hips turned. Don’t make contact with the punch. Twist the hips not towards your partner but almost back towards where you were standing when you first started (perhaps even more), using the shoulder and either punch to the ribs or place the blade of the hand behind the elbow.</p>

        <p>Nikkyo: the hand that grabs the wrist should come from below in order to turn the arm over. Shodan level students should be able to take a nikkyo relatively naturally without it being excruciatingly painful.</p>

        <p>Jo: Hands should always be right on the end and in the middle. Don’t let the forward hand</p>

        <p>Tsuki-jodan-gaeshi-uchi: be in hanmi, jo sitting along the line of your shoulders above your head.</p>

        <p>31-kata #19: Ensure you draw back completely. 31-kata #29: Make a big move backwards.</p>

        <p>31-kata #31: Simply slide the right (forwards) hand closer towards the left (rear) hand as you lift above your head.</p>

        <p>31-kumijo #24-#25: Teach beginners as two separate moves. In reality it should be two tsukis joined (ni-dan tsuki).</p>

        <p>Hanmi: definitely hips forward horizontal and head vertical (not leaning sideways).</p>

        <p>31-kumijo #26: adjust the front foot into hanmi towards your partner to enable the next move to be quick.</p>

        <p>31-kumijo #28 (uke): Make a big move backwards to give enough room.</p>

        <p>31-kumijo #29: Make a big move backwards to have enough room to tsuki.</p>

        <p>31-kumijo #30 (uke): Move the back foot first and parry as you would in say #18 & #22.</p>

        <p>Jo partner practices: Moving backwards is difficult so you must practice it often. Moving forwards is easy (even a child can do it) but moving backwards is hard. Ensure tht you maintain the same distance (ma-ai) between you and your partner at all times.</p>

        <p>Morotedori kokyu nage: Once you’ve taken your partner’s balance, enter in just enough to make contact, remain solid (in hanmi) and twist your hips whilst kokyuing around. Don’t enter in too deply or you will clash (and often put them back on balance).</p>

        <p>Ikkyo omote waza, et al: Always maintain contact with both hands. If the outside hand is losing contact, chances are your opening out too far on the initial move.</p>

        <p>Ikkyo ura waza, et al: Ensure you grip with the outside hand as well otherwise they are more likely to escape.</p>

        <p>Kumitachi/Kumijo: Too much awase practice is no good&mdash;the attacker (uchi-tachi) doesn’t learn where to cut or thrust properly and ends up following the defender (uke-tachi). Always do stop-start practice. Another good practice is to allow the attacker to complete the first half (first step) of their strike/thrust and move on the second half (second step).</p>

        <p>6th awase: start a little further apart than for 5th awase otherwise there is no reason to perform the thrust; the first cut doesn’t reach far enough thus necessitating a thrust.</p>

        <p>Ken Hidari-hanmi: Hands should be slightly closer than on the right-hand-side.</p>

        <p>Suwari-waza Ikkyo omote: Don’t enter in too deeply on the first move. The second step should be as large as possible.</p>

        <p>Suwari-waza Ikkyo ura: The first move should be 70-80% or greater of the technique. It’s pretty much all over after the first move. The remainder is just a pin. Go toe-to-toe (or knee-to-knee) at first but then you can separate in order to generate an ever increasing spiral outwards.</p>

        <p>Morote-dori (and other) kokyu nage: You must understand the distinction between the strong, slightly forwards, tai-no-henko finish-like stance, and the throw at which point your body should be perfectly balanced both vertically and horizontally as you twist your hips to throw.</p>

        <p>Ikkyo omote and ura: you must enter with your feet (and hips at the same time). Don’t cock your hip out as your feet will be too slow.</p>

The first position should be exactly like the finish of 1st suburi and tai-no-henko. This takes your partner off balance. For the throw, the body should be perfectly vertical and horizontal as the hips twist. The movement for the throw should not be on the same line as the first movement.</p>
